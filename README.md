# React Native Hooks âš“

This POC covers the following hooks:
1. useState()
2. useEffect()
3. useRef()
4. useCallback()
5. useMemo()


`Note: useMemo() and useCallback() are used for performance optimization. However, performance optimizations are not free. They always come with a cost but do not always come with a benefit to offset that cost.`

useMemo() & useCallback() are used for the following reasons:
1. Referential equality
2. Computationally expensive calculations
